Version: 0.1.9000
Authors@R: c(
  person("Nicholas", "Spyrison", role = c("aut", "cre"),
    email = "spyrison@gmail.com"))
Description: Given a model, extract the local explanation of every 
  observation in a data set. View the data- and 
  explanation-spaces side-by-side in an interactive shiny application. 
  Further explored a selected point against a 
  comparison by using its explanation as a 1D projection basis. 
  The structure of explanation projection is then explored by a
  radial tour.
