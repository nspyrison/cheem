Description: Given a tree-based model, calculate the local explanation of 
  every observation. View the data space, explanation space, and model 
  information as ensemble graphic interactive on a shiny application.
  After an observation of interest is identified, the normalized 
  variable importance of the local explanation is used as a 1D projection
  basis. The support of the local explanation is then explored by changing
  the basis with the use of the radial, manual tour.
